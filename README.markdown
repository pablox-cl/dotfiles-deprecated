## Conky Notes ##

Conky works like voodoo so IMHO is really hard to share a "beautiful"
conky setup. I'm going to add conkyrcs that I found they work at least
to a tolerable level so it's up to you made it work right. Most times
you need to install some font or some other program that conky uses.

For the same reason I'm **not** installing any conkyrc with the install
script.
